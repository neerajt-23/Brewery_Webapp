#Brewery Review System: 

1. This Flask web application allows users to log in or sign up to access brewery data. 
2. Upon authentication, users can retrieve information about breweries based on city from the https://www.openbrewerydb.org database. 
3. The app then displays a list of specific breweries available in the selected city. 
4. When a user clicks on a particular brewery, detailed information about that brewery and its associated city is presented. 
5. Within the brewery details section, users have the option to add reviews and ratings.
(To run the code unzip templates.zip then execute app.py and now the web app is active)
